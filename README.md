## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Shitova-Marina/Shitova-Marina** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ I am looking for a part-time job for three hours a day, freelancing is possible. I am interested in a remote format (we are ready to work according to the employer's time zone if the difference is no more than 3 hours). Specialization - data analyst, in medical technology and biotech companies, but other areas are also possible (more interesting), I am ready to start work in a week after receiving an offer. I have medium-level working equipment.
For the past ten years, I have been actively involved in data analysis in population genetics. I regularly master new programs. My strong point is planning experiments, searching for patterns and relationships based on the results of the experiment. In the coming months, I plan to master the R environment. On the YandexPracticum platform, I mastered the Python programming language and learned how to conduct a full data analysis in this language. I mastered SQL and working with databases.
